Icosphere
An icosphere is a polyhedral sphere made up of triangles. Icospheres are normally used to achieve a more isotropical layout of vertices than a UV sphere, in other words, they are uniform in every direction.

Subdivisions
How many recursions are used to define the sphere. At level 1 the Icosphere is an icosahedron, a solid with 20 equilateral triangular faces. Each increase in the number of subdivisions splits each triangular face into four triangles.
Note

Subdividing an icosphere raises the vertex count very quickly even with few iterations (10 times creates 5,242,880 triangles), Adding such a dense mesh is a sure way to cause the program to crash.
