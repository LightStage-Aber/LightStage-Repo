UV Sphere
A standard UV sphere is made out of quad faces and a triangle fan at the top and bottom. It can be used for texturing.

Segments
Number of vertical segments. Like the Earth’s meridians, going pole to pole.
Rings
Number of horizontal segments. These are like the Earth’s parallels.

Note
    - Rings are face loops and not edge loops, which would be one less.
